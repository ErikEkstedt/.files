## Config files
All config files that I use. I think.

# Todo:
- [x] FIX colors in ranger... -> Base16
- [ ] Write terminal installation script.
- [ ] Script that starts a terminal and run mountdesk and ssh to desktop. 
- [ ] Scripts for tmux: Notes, logs, todo, calendar.
- [ ] Tweak the tmux scripts so if its attached i3 focuses on that container.
