My configuration. 
Workflow relies on zsh+tmux+vim/oni.

* Most things are configured around <strong>vim/nvim</strong> and <strong>vim keybindings</strong> 
* Minimize mouse use	
* Used [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3) but currently on [kde](https://www.kde.org/)
* Want a regular desktop wm with good tiling capabilities and keyboard
  movement
* Nvidia for machine learning

---------------

**Trying out:** 
* Oni
  * <strong>Vim</strong> is by far the best and most comfortable way of coding
  * UI - electron. Nice colors. Nice menus.
  * After some time in Oni getting back to terminal vim felt really good...
  * Even switched to VSCode to do some webdev

<strong>Web-dev:</strong>
* VSCode
* Vim-plugin makes it on the surface really great. But 
* Has really great built-in support for web-dev
