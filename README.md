## Config files
All config files that I use. I think.

# Todo:
- [x] FIX colors in ranger... -> Base16
- [ ] Write terminal installation script.
- [ ] Script that starts a terminal and run mountdesk and ssh to desktop. 
- [ ] Scripts for tmux: Notes, logs, todo, calendar.
- [ ] Tweak the tmux scripts so if its attached i3 focuses on that container.
- [ ] Fix Calendar vim - might help in productivty / goals.


## Vim

- [ ] Look into a way for vimtex to open preview in tmux.
- [ ] Latex ftplugin does not work? a function that sets linebreak and textwidth.
  - tried to add linebreak whenever using a tex file. but i dont want linebreak in code. tried to add code in ftplugin tex.vim.
- [ ] [vim-man](https://github.com/vim-utils/vim-man) - Read man files in vim. A nice way of open man pages in vim from terminal.
