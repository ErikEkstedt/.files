My configuration. 
Workflow relies on zsh+tmux+vim/oni.

* Most things are configured around vim/nvim and vim keybindings
* Minimize mouse use	
* Used i3 but currently on kde
* Want a regular desktop wm with good tiling capabilities and keyboard
  movement

* Development environment
* Nvidia for machine learning

---------------

**Trying out:** 
* Oni
  * Vim is by far the best and most comfortable way of coding
  * Plugins to atom/vscode is not keyboard friendly enough. Relies on
	mouse too heavily.
  * UI - electron. Nice colors. Nice menus.
  * After some time in Oni getting back to terminal vim felt really good...
