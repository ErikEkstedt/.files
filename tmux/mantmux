NAME
     tmux — terminal multiplexer

SYNOPSIS
     tmux [-2CluvV] [-c shell-command] [-f file] [-L socket-name] [-S socket-path] [command [flags]]

DESCRIPTION
     tmux is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals to be created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen.  tmux may be detached from a
     screen and continue running in the background, then later reattached.

     When tmux is started it creates a new session with a single window and displays it on screen.  A status line at the bottom of the screen shows information on
     the current session and is used to enter interactive commands.

     A session is a single collection of pseudo terminals under the management of tmux.  Each session has one or more windows linked to it.  A window occupies the
     entire screen and may be split into rectangular panes, each of which is a separate pseudo terminal (the pty(4) manual page documents the technical details of
     pseudo terminals).  Any number of tmux instances may connect to the same session, and any number of windows may be present in the same session.  Once all ses‐
     sions are killed, tmux exits.

     Each session is persistent and will survive accidental disconnection (such as ssh(1) connection timeout) or intentional detaching (with the ‘C-b d’ key
     strokes).  tmux may be reattached using:

           $ tmux attach

     In tmux, a session is displayed on screen by a client and all sessions are managed by a single server.  The server and each client are separate processes which
     communicate through a socket in /tmp.

     The options are as follows:

     -2            Force tmux to assume the terminal supports 256 colours.

     -C            Start in control mode (see the CONTROL MODE section).  Given twice (-CC) disables echo.

     -c shell-command
                   Execute shell-command using the default shell.  If necessary, the tmux server will be started to retrieve the default-shell option.  This option
                   is for compatibility with sh(1) when tmux is used as a login shell.

     -f file       Specify an alternative configuration file.  By default, tmux loads the system configuration file from /etc/tmux.conf, if present, then looks for
                   a user configuration file at ~/.tmux.conf.

                   The configuration file is a set of tmux commands which are executed in sequence when the server is first started.  tmux loads configuration files
                   once when the server process has started.  The source-file command may be used to load a file later.

                   tmux shows any error messages from commands in configuration files in the first session created, and continues to process the rest of the config‐
                   uration file.

     -L socket-name
                   tmux stores the server socket in a directory under TMUX_TMPDIR or /tmp if it is unset.  The default socket is named default.  This option allows
                   a different socket name to be specified, allowing several independent tmux servers to be run.  Unlike -S a full path is not necessary: the sock‐
                   ets are all created in the same directory.

                   If the socket is accidentally removed, the SIGUSR1 signal may be sent to the tmux server process to recreate it (note that this will fail if any
                   parent directories are missing).

     -l            Behave as a login shell.  This flag currently has no effect and is for compatibility with other shells when using tmux as a login shell.

     -S socket-path
                   Specify a full alternative path to the server socket.  If -S is specified, the default socket directory is not used and any -L flag is ignored.

     -u            When starting, tmux looks for the LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE and LANG environment variables: if the first found contains ‘UTF-8’, then the terminal is
                   assumed to support UTF-8.  This is not always correct: the -u flag explicitly informs tmux that UTF-8 is supported.

                   Note that tmux itself always accepts UTF-8; this controls whether it will send UTF-8 characters to the terminal it is running (if not, they are
                   replaced by ‘_’).

     -v            Request verbose logging.  Log messages will be saved into tmux-client-PID.log and tmux-server-PID.log files in the current directory, where PID
                   is the PID of the server or client process.  If -v is specified twice, an additional tmux-out-PID.log file is generated with a copy of everything
                   tmux writes to the terminal.

                   The SIGUSR2 signal may be sent to the tmux server process to toggle logging between on (as if -v was given) and off.

     -V            Report the tmux version.

     command [flags]
                   This specifies one of a set of commands used to control tmux, as described in the following sections.  If no commands are specified, the
                   new-session command is assumed.

KEY BINDINGS
     tmux may be controlled from an attached client by using a key combination of a prefix key, ‘C-b’ (Ctrl-b) by default, followed by a command key.

     The default command key bindings are:

           C-b         Send the prefix key (C-b) through to the application.
           C-o         Rotate the panes in the current window forwards.
           C-z         Suspend the tmux client.
           !           Break the current pane out of the window.
           "           Split the current pane into two, top and bottom.
           #           List all paste buffers.
           $           Rename the current session.
           %           Split the current pane into two, left and right.

           ,           Rename the current window.
           -           Delete the most recently copied buffer of text.
           .           Prompt for an index to move the current window.
           0 to 9      Select windows 0 to 9.
           :           Enter the tmux command prompt.
           ;           Move to the previously active pane.
           =           Choose which buffer to paste interactively from a list.
           ?           List all key bindings.

           M-Left, M-Right
                       Resize the current pane in steps of five cells.

     Key bindings may be changed with the bind-key and unbind-key commands.

COMMANDS
     This section contains a list of the commands supported by tmux.  Most commands accept the optional -t (and sometimes -s) argument with one of target-client,
     target-session target-window, or target-pane.  These specify the client, session, window or pane which a command should affect.

     target-client should be the name of the client, typically the pty(4) file to which the client is connected, for example either of /dev/ttyp1 or ttyp1 for the
     client attached to /dev/ttyp1.  If no client is specified, tmux attempts to work out the client currently in use; if that fails, an error is reported.  Clients
     may be listed with the list-clients command.

     target-session is tried as, in order:

           1.   A session ID prefixed with a $.

           2.   An exact name of a session (as listed by the list-sessions command).

           3.   The start of a session name, for example ‘mysess’ would match a session named ‘mysession’.

           4.   An fnmatch(3) pattern which is matched against the session name.

     If the session name is prefixed with an ‘=’, only an exact match is accepted (so ‘=mysess’ will only match exactly ‘mysess’, not ‘mysession’).

     If a single session is found, it is used as the target session; multiple matches produce an error.  If a session is omitted, the current session is used if
     available; if no current session is available, the most recently used is chosen.

     target-window (or src-window or dst-window) specifies a window in the form session:window.  session follows the same rules as for target-session, and window is
     looked for in order as:

           1.   A special token, listed below.

           2.   A window index, for example ‘mysession:1’ is window 1 in session ‘mysession’.

           3.   A window ID, such as @1.

           4.   An exact window name, such as ‘mysession:mywindow’.

           5.   The start of a window name, such as ‘mysession:mywin’.

           6.   As an fnmatch(3) pattern matched against the window name.

     Like sessions, a ‘=’ prefix will do an exact match only.  An empty window name specifies the next unused index if appropriate (for example the new-window and
     link-window commands) otherwise the current window in session is chosen.

     The following special tokens are available to indicate particular windows.  Each has a single-character alternative form.

     Token              Meaning
     {start}       ^    The lowest-numbered window
     {end}         $    The highest-numbered window
     {last}        !    The last (previously current) window
     {next}        +    The next window by number
     {previous}    -    The previous window by number

     target-pane (or src-pane or dst-pane) may be a pane ID or takes a similar form to target-window but with the optional addition of a period followed by a pane
     index or pane ID, for example: ‘mysession:mywindow.1’.  If the pane index is omitted, the currently active pane in the specified window is used.  The following
     special tokens are available for the pane index:

     Token                  Meaning
     {last}            !    The last (previously active) pane
     {next}            +    The next pane by number
     {previous}        -    The previous pane by number
     {top}                  The top pane
     {bottom}               The bottom pane
     {left}                 The leftmost pane
     {right}                The rightmost pane
     {top-left}             The top-left pane
     {top-right}            The top-right pane
     {bottom-left}          The bottom-left pane
     {bottom-right}         The bottom-right pane
     {up-of}                The pane above the active pane
     {down-of}              The pane below the active pane
     {left-of}              The pane to the left of the active pane
     {right-of}             The pane to the right of the active pane

     The tokens ‘+’ and ‘-’ may be followed by an offset, for example:

           select-window -t:+2

     In addition, target-session, target-window or target-pane may consist entirely of the token ‘{mouse}’ (alternative form ‘=’) to specify the most recent mouse
     event (see the MOUSE SUPPORT section) or ‘{marked}’ (alternative form ‘~’) to specify the marked pane (see select-pane -m).

     Sessions, window and panes are each numbered with a unique ID; session IDs are prefixed with a ‘$’, windows with a ‘@’, and panes with a ‘%’.  These are unique
     and are unchanged for the life of the session, window or pane in the tmux server.  The pane ID is passed to the child process of the pane in the TMUX_PANE
     environment variable.  IDs may be displayed using the ‘session_id’, ‘window_id’, or ‘pane_id’ formats (see the FORMATS section) and the display-message,
     list-sessions, list-windows or list-panes commands.

     shell-command arguments are sh(1) commands.  This may be a single argument passed to the shell, for example:

           new-window 'vi /etc/passwd'

     Will run:

           /bin/sh -c 'vi /etc/passwd'

     Additionally, the new-window, new-session, split-window, respawn-window and respawn-pane commands allow shell-command to be given as multiple arguments and
     executed directly (without ‘sh -c’).  This can avoid issues with shell quoting.  For example:

           $ tmux new-window vi /etc/passwd

     Will run vi(1) directly without invoking the shell.

     command [arguments] refers to a tmux command, passed with the command and arguments separately, for example:

           bind-key F1 set-window-option force-width 81

     Or if using sh(1):

           $ tmux bind-key F1 set-window-option force-width 81

     Multiple commands may be specified together as part of a command sequence.  Each command should be separated by spaces and a semicolon; commands are executed
     sequentially from left to right and lines ending with a backslash continue on to the next line, except when escaped by another backslash.  A literal semicolon
     may be included by escaping it with a backslash (for example, when specifying a command sequence to bind-key).

     Example tmux commands include:

           refresh-client -t/dev/ttyp2

           rename-session -tfirst newname

           set-window-option -t:0 monitor-activity on

           new-window ; split-window -d

           bind-key R source-file ~/.tmux.conf \; \
                   display-message "source-file done"

     Or from sh(1):

           $ tmux kill-window -t :1

           $ tmux new-window \; split-window -d

           $ tmux new-session -d 'vi /etc/passwd' \; split-window -d \; attach

CLIENTS AND SESSIONS
     The tmux server manages clients, sessions, windows and panes.  Clients are attached to sessions to interact with them, either when they are created with the
     new-session command, or later with the attach-session command.  Each session has one or more windows linked into it.  Windows may be linked to multiple ses‐
     sions and are made up of one or more panes, each of which contains a pseudo terminal.  Commands for creating, linking and otherwise manipulating windows are
     covered in the WINDOWS AND PANES section.

     The following commands are available to manage clients and sessions:

     attach-session [-dEr] [-c working-directory] [-t target-session]
                   (alias: attach)
             If run from outside tmux, create a new client in the current terminal and attach it to target-session.  If used from inside, switch the current client.
             If -d is specified, any other clients attached to the session are detached.  -r signifies the client is read-only (only keys bound to the detach-client
             or switch-client commands have any effect)

             If no server is started, attach-session will attempt to start it; this will fail unless sessions are created in the configuration file.

             The target-session rules for attach-session are slightly adjusted: if tmux needs to select the most recently used session, it will prefer the most
             recently used unattached session.

             -c will set the session working directory (used for new windows) to working-directory.

             If -E is used, the update-environment option will not be applied.

     detach-client [-aP] [-E shell-command] [-s target-session] [-t target-client]
                   (alias: detach)
             Detach the current client if bound to a key, the client specified with -t, or all clients currently attached to the session specified by -s.  The -a
             option kills all but the client given with -t.  If -P is given, send SIGHUP to the parent process of the client, typically causing it to exit.  With
             -E, run shell-command to replace the client.

     has-session [-t target-session]
                   (alias: has)
             Report an error and exit with 1 if the specified session does not exist.  If it does exist, exit with 0.

     kill-server
             Kill the tmux server and clients and destroy all sessions.

     kill-session [-aC] [-t target-session]
             Destroy the given session, closing any windows linked to it and no other sessions, and detaching all clients attached to it.  If -a is given, all ses‐
             sions but the specified one is killed.  The -C flag clears alerts (bell, activity, or silence) in all windows linked to the session.

     list-clients [-F format] [-t target-session]
                   (alias: lsc)
             List all clients attached to the server.  For the meaning of the -F flag, see the FORMATS section.  If target-session is specified, list only clients
             connected to that session.

     list-commands [-F format]
                   (alias: lscm)
             List the syntax of all commands supported by tmux.

     list-sessions [-F format]
                   (alias: ls)
             List all sessions managed by the server.  For the meaning of the -F flag, see the FORMATS section.

     lock-client [-t target-client]
                   (alias: lockc)
             Lock target-client, see the lock-server command.

     lock-session [-t target-session]
                   (alias: locks)
             Lock all clients attached to target-session.

     new-session [-AdDEP] [-c start-directory] [-F format] [-n window-name] [-s session-name] [-t group-name] [-x width] [-y height] [shell-command]
                   (alias: new)
             Create a new session with name session-name.

             The new session is attached to the current terminal unless -d is given.  window-name and shell-command are the name of and shell command to execute in
             the initial window.  With -d, the initial size is 80 x 24; -x and -y can be used to specify a different size.

             If run from a terminal, any termios(4) special characters are saved and used for new windows in the new session.

             The -A flag makes new-session behave like attach-session if session-name already exists; in this case, -D behaves like -d to attach-session.

             If -t is given, it specifies a session group.  Sessions in the same group share the same set of windows - new windows are linked to all sessions in the
             group and any windows closed removed from all sessions.  The current and previous window and any session options remain independent and any session in
             a group may be killed without affecting the others.  The group-name argument may be:

             1.      the name of an existing group, in which case the new session is added to that group;

             2.      the name of an existing session - the new session is added to the same group as that session, creating a new group if necessary;

             3.      the name for a new group containing only the new session.

             -n and shell-command are invalid if -t is used.

             The -P option prints information about the new session after it has been created.  By default, it uses the format ‘#{session_name}:’ but a different
             format may be specified with -F.

             If -E is used, the update-environment option will not be applied.

     refresh-client [-C width,height] [-S] [-t target-client]
                   (alias: refresh)
             Refresh the current client if bound to a key, or a single client if one is given with -t.  If -S is specified, only update the client's status line.

             -C sets the width and height of a control client.

     rename-session [-t target-session] new-name
                   (alias: rename)
             Rename the session to new-name.

     show-messages [-JT] [-t target-client]
                   (alias: showmsgs)
             Show client messages or server information.  Any messages displayed on the status line are saved in a per-client message log, up to a maximum of the
             limit set by the message-limit server option.  With -t, display the log for target-client.  -J and -T show debugging information about jobs and termi‐
             nals.

     source-file [-q] path
                   (alias: source)
             Execute commands from path (which may be a glob(3) pattern).  If -q is given, no error will be returned if path does not exist.

             Within a configuration file, commands may be made conditional by surrounding them with %if and %endif lines.  The argument to %if is expanded as a for‐
             mat and if it evaluates to false (zero or empty), subsequent lines are ignored until %endif.  For example:

                   %if #{==:#{host},myhost}
                   set -g status-style bg=red
                   %endif

             Will change the status line to red if running on ‘myhost’.  %if may not be nested.

     start-server
                   (alias: start)
             Start the tmux server, if not already running, without creating any sessions.

     suspend-client [-t target-client]
                   (alias: suspendc)
             Suspend a client by sending SIGTSTP (tty stop).

     switch-client [-Elnpr] [-c target-client] [-t target-session] [-T key-table]
                   (alias: switchc)
             Switch the current session for client target-client to target-session.  If -l, -n or -p is used, the client is moved to the last, next or previous ses‐
             sion respectively.  -r toggles whether a client is read-only (see the attach-session command).

             If -E is used, update-environment option will not be applied.

             -T sets the client's key table; the next key from the client will be interpreted from key-table.  This may be used to configure multiple prefix keys,
             or to bind commands to sequences of keys.  For example, to make typing ‘abc’ run the list-keys command:

                   bind-key -Ttable2 c list-keys
                   bind-key -Ttable1 b switch-client -Ttable2
                   bind-key -Troot   a switch-client -Ttable1

WINDOWS AND PANES
     A tmux window may be in one of two modes.  The default permits direct access to the terminal attached to the window.  The other is copy mode, which permits a
     section of a window or its history to be copied to a paste buffer for later insertion into another window.  This mode is entered with the copy-mode command,
     bound to ‘[’ by default.  It is also entered when a command that produces output, such as list-keys, is executed from a key binding.

     Commands are sent to copy mode using the -X flag to the send-keys command.  When a key is pressed, copy mode automatically uses one of two key tables, depend‐
     ing on the mode-keys option: copy-mode for emacs, or copy-mode-vi for vi.  Key tables may be viewed with the list-keys command.

     The following commands are supported in copy mode:

           Command                              vi              emacs
           append-selection

           top-line                             H               M-R

     The next and previous word keys use space and the ‘-’, ‘_’ and ‘@’ characters as word delimiters by default, but this can be adjusted by setting the
     word-separators session option.  Next word moves to the start of the next word, next word end to the end of the next word and previous word to the start of the
     previous word.  The three next and previous space keys work similarly but use a space alone as the word separator.

     The jump commands enable quick movement within a line.  For instance, typing ‘f’ followed by ‘/’ will move the cursor to the next ‘/’ character on the current
     line.  A ‘;’ will then jump to the next occurrence.

     Commands in copy mode may be prefaced by an optional repeat count.  With vi key bindings, a prefix is entered using the number keys; with emacs, the Alt (meta)
     key and a number begins prefix entry.

     The synopsis for the copy-mode command is:

     copy-mode [-Meu] [-t target-pane]
             Enter copy mode.  The -u option scrolls one page up.  -M begins a mouse drag (only valid if bound to a mouse key binding, see MOUSE SUPPORT).  -e spec‐
             ifies that scrolling to the bottom of the history (to the visible screen) should exit copy mode.  While in copy mode, pressing a key other than those
             used for scrolling will disable this behaviour.  This is intended to allow fast scrolling through a pane's history, for example with:

                   bind PageUp copy-mode -eu

     Each window displayed by tmux may be split into one or more panes; each pane takes up a certain area of the display and is a separate terminal.  A window may
     be split into panes using the split-window command.  Windows may be split horizontally (with the -h flag) or vertically.  Panes may be resized with the
     resize-pane command (bound to ‘C-Up’, ‘C-Down’ ‘C-Left’ and ‘C-Right’ by default), the current pane may be changed with the select-pane command and the
     rotate-window and swap-pane commands may be used to swap panes without changing their position.  Panes are numbered beginning from zero in the order they are
     created.

     A number of preset layouts are available.  These may be selected with the select-layout command or cycled with next-layout (bound to ‘Space’ by default); once
     a layout is chosen, panes within it may be moved and resized as normal.

     The following layouts are supported:

     even-horizontal
             Panes are spread out evenly from left to right across the window.

     even-vertical
             Panes are spread evenly from top to bottom.

     main-horizontal
             A large (main) pane is shown at the top of the window and the remaining panes are spread from left to right in the leftover space at the bottom.  Use
             the main-pane-height window option to specify the height of the top pane.

     main-vertical
             Similar to main-horizontal but the large pane is placed on the left and the others spread from top to bottom along the right.  See the main-pane-width
             window option.

     tiled   Panes are spread out as evenly as possible over the window in both rows and columns.

     In addition, select-layout may be used to apply a previously used layout - the list-windows command displays the layout of each window in a form suitable for
     use with select-layout.  For example:

           $ tmux list-windows
           0: ksh [159x48]
               layout: bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}
           $ tmux select-layout bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}

     tmux automatically adjusts the size of the layout for the current window size.  Note that a layout cannot be applied to a window with more panes than that from
     which the layout was originally defined.

     Commands related to windows and panes are as follows:

     break-pane [-dP] [-F format] [-n window-name] [-s src-pane] [-t dst-window]
                   (alias: breakp)
             Break src-pane off from its containing window to make it the only pane in dst-window.  If -d is given, the new window does not become the current win‐
             dow.  The -P option prints information about the new window after it has been created.  By default, it uses the format
             ‘#{session_name}:#{window_index}’ but a different format may be specified with -F.

     capture-pane [-aepPqCJ] [-b buffer-name] [-E end-line] [-S start-line] [-t target-pane]
                   (alias: capturep)
             Capture the contents of a pane.  If -p is given, the output goes to stdout, otherwise to the buffer specified with -b or a new buffer if omitted.  If
             -a is given, the alternate screen is used, and the history is not accessible.  If no alternate screen exists, an error will be returned unless -q is
             given.  If -e is given, the output includes escape sequences for text and background attributes.  -C also escapes non-printable characters as octal
             \xxx.  -J joins wrapped lines and preserves trailing spaces at each line's end.  -P captures only any output that the pane has received that is the
             beginning of an as-yet incomplete escape sequence.

             -S and -E specify the starting and ending line numbers, zero is the first line of the visible pane and negative numbers are lines in the history.  ‘-’
             to -S is the start of the history and to -E the end of the visible pane.  The default is to capture only the visible contents of the pane.

     choose-client [-N] [-F format] [-f filter] [-O sort-order] [-t target-pane] [template]
             Put a pane into client mode, allowing a client to be selected interactively from a list.  The following keys may be used in client mode:

                   Key    Function
                   Enter  Choose selected client
                   Up     Select previous client
                   Down   Select next client
                   C-s    Search by name
                   n      Repeat last search
                   t      Toggle if client is tagged
                   T      Tag no clients
                   C-t    Tag all clients
                   d      Detach selected client
                   D      Detach tagged clients
                   x      Detach and HUP selected client
                   X      Detach and HUP tagged clients
                   z      Suspend selected client
                   Z      Suspend tagged clients
                   f      Enter a format to filter items
                   O      Change sort order
                   v      Toggle preview
                   q      Exit mode

             After a client is chosen, ‘%%’ is replaced by the client name in template and the result executed as a command.  If template is not given, "detach-
             client -t '%%'" is used.

             -O specifies the initial sort order: one of ‘name’, ‘size’, ‘creation’, or ‘activity’.  -f specifies an initial filter: the filter is a format - if it
             evaluates to zero, the item in the list is not shown, otherwise it is shown.  If a filter would lead to an empty list, it is ignored.  -F specifies the
             format for each item in the list.  -N starts without the preview.  This command works only if at least one client is attached.

     choose-tree [-Nsw] [-F format] [-f filter] [-O sort-order] [-t target-pane] [template]
             Put a pane into tree mode, where a session, window or pane may be chosen interactively from a list.  -s starts with sessions collapsed and -w with win‐
             dows collapsed.  The following keys may be used in tree mode:

                   Key    Function
                   Enter  Choose selected item
                   Up     Select previous item
                   Down   Select next item
                   <      Scroll list of previews left
                   >      Scroll list of previews right
                   C-s    Search by name
                   n      Repeat last search
                   t      Toggle if item is tagged
                   T      Tag no items
                   C-t    Tag all items
                   :      Run a command for each tagged item
                   f      Enter a format to filter items
                   O      Change sort order
                   v      Toggle preview
                   q      Exit mode

             After a session, window or pane is chosen, ‘%%’ is replaced by the target in template and the result executed as a command.  If template is not given,
             "switch-client -t '%%'" is used.

             -O specifies the initial sort order: one of ‘index’, ‘name’, or ‘time’.  -f specifies an initial filter: the filter is a format - if it evaluates to
             zero, the item in the list is not shown, otherwise it is shown.  If a filter would lead to an empty list, it is ignored.  -F specifies the format for
             each item in the tree.  -N starts without the preview.  This command works only if at least one client is attached.

     display-panes [-d duration] [-t target-client] [template]
                   (alias: displayp)
             Display a visible indicator of each pane shown by target-client.  See the display-panes-colour and display-panes-active-colour session options.  The
             indicator is closed when a key is pressed or duration milliseconds have passed.  If -d is not given, display-panes-time is used.  A duration of zero
             means the indicator stays until a key is pressed.  While the indicator is on screen, a pane may be chosen with the ‘0’ to ‘9’ keys, which will cause
             template to be executed as a command with ‘%%’ substituted by the pane ID.  The default template is "select-pane -t '%%'".

     find-window [-CNT] [-t target-pane] match-string
                   (alias: findw)
             Search for the fnmatch(3) pattern match-string in window names, titles, and visible content (but not history).  The flags control matching behavior: -C
             matches only visible window contents, -N matches only the window name and -T matches only the window title.  The default is -CNT.

             This command works only if at least one client is attached.

     join-pane [-bdhv] [-l size | -p percentage] [-s src-pane] [-t dst-pane]
                   (alias: joinp)
             Like split-window, but instead of splitting dst-pane and creating a new pane, split it and move src-pane into the space.  This can be used to reverse
             break-pane.  The -b option causes src-pane to be joined to left of or above dst-pane.

             If -s is omitted and a marked pane is present (see select-pane -m), the marked pane is used rather than the current pane.

     kill-pane [-a] [-t target-pane]
                   (alias: killp)
             Destroy the given pane.  If no panes remain in the containing window, it is also destroyed.  The -a option kills all but the pane given with -t.

     kill-window [-a] [-t target-window]
                   (alias: killw)
             Kill the current window or the window at target-window, removing it from any sessions to which it is linked.  The -a option kills all but the window
             given with -t.

     last-pane [-de] [-t target-window]
                   (alias: lastp)
             Select the last (previously selected) pane.  -e enables or -d disables input to the pane.

     last-window [-t target-session]
                   (alias: last)
             Select the last (previously selected) window.  If no target-session is specified, select the last window of the current session.

     link-window [-adk] [-s src-window] [-t dst-window]
                   (alias: linkw)
             Link the window at src-window to the specified dst-window.  If dst-window is specified and no such window exists, the src-window is linked there.  With
             -a, the window is moved to the next index up (following windows are moved if necessary).  If -k is given and dst-window exists, it is killed, otherwise
             an error is generated.  If -d is given, the newly linked window is not selected.

     list-panes [-as] [-F format] [-t target]
                   (alias: lsp)
             If -a is given, target is ignored and all panes on the server are listed.  If -s is given, target is a session (or the current session).  If neither is
             given, target is a window (or the current window).  For the meaning of the -F flag, see the FORMATS section.

     list-windows [-a] [-F format] [-t target-session]
                   (alias: lsw)
             If -a is given, list all windows on the server.  Otherwise, list windows in the current session or in target-session.  For the meaning of the -F flag,
             see the FORMATS section.

     move-pane [-bdhv] [-l size | -p percentage] [-s src-pane] [-t dst-pane]
                   (alias: movep)
             Like join-pane, but src-pane and dst-pane may belong to the same window.

     move-window [-ardk] [-s src-window] [-t dst-window]
                   (alias: movew)
             This is similar to link-window, except the window at src-window is moved to dst-window.  With -r, all windows in the session are renumbered in sequen‐
             tial order, respecting the base-index option.

     new-window [-adkP] [-c start-directory] [-F format] [-n window-name] [-t target-window] [shell-command]
                   (alias: neww)
             Create a new window.  With -a, the new window is inserted at the next index up from the specified target-window, moving windows up if necessary, other‐
             wise target-window is the new window location.

             If -d is given, the session does not make the new window the current window.  target-window represents the window to be created; if the target already
             exists an error is shown, unless the -k flag is used, in which case it is destroyed.  shell-command is the command to execute.  If shell-command is not
             specified, the value of the default-command option is used.  -c specifies the working directory in which the new window is created.

             When the shell command completes, the window closes.  See the remain-on-exit option to change this behaviour.

             The TERM environment variable must be set to ‘screen’ or ‘tmux’ for all programs running inside tmux.  New windows will automatically have
             ‘TERM=screen’ added to their environment, but care must be taken not to reset this in shell start-up files.

             The -P option prints information about the new window after it has been created.  By default, it uses the format ‘#{session_name}:#{window_index}’ but
             a different format may be specified with -F.

     next-layout [-t target-window]
                   (alias: nextl)
             Move a window to the next layout and rearrange the panes to fit.

     next-window [-a] [-t target-session]
                   (alias: next)
             Move to the next window in the session.  If -a is used, move to the next window with an alert.

     pipe-pane [-o] [-t target-pane] [shell-command]
                   (alias: pipep)
             Pipe any output sent by the program in target-pane to a shell command.  A pane may only be piped to one command at a time, any existing pipe is closed
             before shell-command is executed.  The shell-command string may contain the special character sequences supported by the status-left option.  If no
             shell-command is given, the current pipe (if any) is closed.

             The -o option only opens a new pipe if no previous pipe exists, allowing a pipe to be toggled with a single key, for example:

                   bind-key C-p pipe-pane -o 'cat >>~/output.#I-#P'

     previous-layout [-t target-window]
                   (alias: prevl)
             Move to the previous layout in the session.

     previous-window [-a] [-t target-session]
                   (alias: prev)
             Move to the previous window in the session.  With -a, move to the previous window with an alert.

     rename-window [-t target-window] new-name
                   (alias: renamew)
             Rename the current window, or the window at target-window if specified, to new-name.

     resize-pane [-DLMRUZ] [-t target-pane] [-x width] [-y height] [adjustment]
                   (alias: resizep)
             Resize a pane, up, down, left or right by adjustment with -U, -D, -L or -R, or to an absolute size with -x or -y.  The adjustment is given in lines or
             cells (the default is 1).

             With -Z, the active pane is toggled between zoomed (occupying the whole of the window) and unzoomed (its normal position in the layout).

             -M begins mouse resizing (only valid if bound to a mouse key binding, see MOUSE SUPPORT).

     respawn-pane [-c start-directory] [-k] [-t target-pane] [shell-command]
                   (alias: respawnp)
             Reactivate a pane in which the command has exited (see the remain-on-exit window option).  If shell-command is not given, the command used when the
             pane was created is executed.  The pane must be already inactive, unless -k is given, in which case any existing command is killed.  -c specifies a new
             working directory for the pane.

     respawn-window [-c start-directory] [-k] [-t target-window] [shell-command]
                   (alias: respawnw)
             Reactivate a window in which the command has exited (see the remain-on-exit window option).  If shell-command is not given, the command used when the
             window was created is executed.  The window must be already inactive, unless -k is given, in which case any existing command is killed.  -c specifies a
             new working directory for the window.

     rotate-window [-DU] [-t target-window]
                   (alias: rotatew)
             Rotate the positions of the panes within a window, either upward (numerically lower) with -U or downward (numerically higher).

     select-layout [-nop] [-t target-window] [layout-name]
                   (alias: selectl)
             Choose a specific layout for a window.  If layout-name is not given, the last preset layout used (if any) is reapplied.  -n and -p are equivalent to
             the next-layout and previous-layout commands.  -o applies the last set layout if possible (undoes the most recent layout change).

     select-pane [-DdegLlMmRU] [-P style] [-T title] [-t target-pane]
                   (alias: selectp)
             Make pane target-pane the active pane in window target-window, or set its style (with -P).  If one of -D, -L, -R, or -U is used, respectively the pane
             below, to the left, to the right, or above the target pane is used.  -l is the same as using the last-pane command.  -e enables or -d disables input to
             the pane.

             -m and -M are used to set and clear the marked pane.  There is one marked pane at a time, setting a new marked pane clears the last.  The marked pane
             is the default target for -s to join-pane, swap-pane and swap-window.

             Each pane has a style: by default the window-style and window-active-style options are used, select-pane -P sets the style for a single pane.  For
             example, to set the pane 1 background to red:

                   select-pane -t:.1 -P 'bg=red'

             -g shows the current pane style.

             -T sets the pane title.

     select-window [-lnpT] [-t target-window]
                   (alias: selectw)
             Select the window at target-window.  -l, -n and -p are equivalent to the last-window, next-window and previous-window commands.  If -T is given and the
             selected window is already the current window, the command behaves like last-window.

     split-window [-bdfhvP] [-c start-directory] [-l size | -p percentage] [-t target-pane] [shell-command] [-F format]
                   (alias: splitw)
             Create a new pane by splitting target-pane: -h does a horizontal split and -v a vertical split; if neither is specified, -v is assumed.  The -l and -p
             options specify the size of the new pane in lines (for vertical split) or in cells (for horizontal split), or as a percentage, respectively.  The -b
             option causes the new pane to be created to the left of or above target-pane.  The -f option creates a new pane spanning the full window height (with
             -h) or full window width (with -v), instead of splitting the active pane.  All other options have the same meaning as for the new-window command.

     swap-pane [-dDU] [-s src-pane] [-t dst-pane]
                   (alias: swapp)
             Swap two panes.  If -U is used and no source pane is specified with -s, dst-pane is swapped with the previous pane (before it numerically); -D swaps
             with the next pane (after it numerically).  -d instructs tmux not to change the active pane.

             If -s is omitted and a marked pane is present (see select-pane -m), the marked pane is used rather than the current pane.

     swap-window [-d] [-s src-window] [-t dst-window]
                   (alias: swapw)
             This is similar to link-window, except the source and destination windows are swapped.  It is an error if no window exists at src-window.

             Like swap-pane, if -s is omitted and a marked pane is present (see select-pane -m), the window containing the marked pane is used rather than the cur‐
             rent window.

     unlink-window [-k] [-t target-window]
                   (alias: unlinkw)
             Unlink target-window.  Unless -k is given, a window may be unlinked only if it is linked to multiple sessions - windows may not be linked to no ses‐
             sions; if -k is specified and the window is linked to only one session, it is unlinked and destroyed.

KEY BINDINGS
     tmux allows a command to be bound to most keys, with or without a prefix key.  When specifying keys, most represent themselves (for example ‘A’ to ‘Z’).  Ctrl
     keys may be prefixed with ‘C-’ or ‘^’, and Alt (meta) with ‘M-’.  In addition, the following special key names are accepted: Up, Down, Left, Right, BSpace,
     BTab, DC (Delete), End, Enter, Escape, F1 to F12, Home, IC (Insert), NPage/PageDown/PgDn, PPage/PageUp/PgUp, Space, and Tab.  Note that to bind the ‘"’ or ‘'’
     keys, quotation marks are necessary, for example:

           bind-key '"' split-window
           bind-key "'" new-window

     Commands related to key bindings are as follows:

     bind-key [-nr] [-T key-table] key command [arguments]
                   (alias: bind)
             Bind key key to command.  Keys are bound in a key table.  By default (without -T), the key is bound in the prefix key table.  This table is used for
             keys pressed after the prefix key (for example, by default ‘c’ is bound to new-window in the prefix table, so ‘C-b c’ creates a new window).  The root
             table is used for keys pressed without the prefix key: binding ‘c’ to new-window in the root table (not recommended) means a plain ‘c’ will create a
             new window.  -n is an alias for -T root.  Keys may also be bound in custom key tables and the switch-client -T command used to switch to them from a
             key binding.  The -r flag indicates this key may repeat, see the repeat-time option.

             To view the default bindings and possible commands, see the list-keys command.

     list-keys [-T key-table]
                   (alias: lsk)
             List all key bindings.  Without -T all key tables are printed.  With -T only key-table.

     send-keys [-lMRX] [-N repeat-count] [-t target-pane] key ...
                   (alias: send)
             Send a key or keys to a window.  Each argument key is the name of the key (such as ‘C-a’ or ‘NPage’) to send; if the string is not recognised as a key,
             it is sent as a series of characters.  The -l flag disables key name lookup and sends the keys literally.  All arguments are sent sequentially from
             first to last.  The -R flag causes the terminal state to be reset.

             -M passes through a mouse event (only valid if bound to a mouse key binding, see MOUSE SUPPORT).

             -X is used to send a command into copy mode - see the WINDOWS AND PANES section.  -N specifies a repeat count.

     send-prefix [-2] [-t target-pane]
             Send the prefix key, or with -2 the secondary prefix key, to a window as if it was pressed.

     unbind-key [-an] [-T key-table] key
                   (alias: unbind)
             Unbind the command bound to key.  -n and -T are the same as for bind-key.  If -a is present, all key bindings are removed.

OPTIONS
     The appearance and behaviour of tmux may be modified by changing the value of various options.  There are three types of option: server options, session
     options and window options.

     The tmux server has a set of global options which do not apply to any particular window or session.  These are altered with the set-option -s command, or dis‐
     played with the show-options -s command.

     In addition, each individual session may have a set of session options, and there is a separate set of global session options.  Sessions which do not have a
     particular option configured inherit the value from the global session options.  Session options are set or unset with the set-option command and may be listed
     with the show-options command.  The available server and session options are listed under the set-option command.

     Similarly, a set of window options is attached to each window, and there is a set of global window options from which any unset options are inherited.  Window
     options are altered with the set-window-option command and can be listed with the show-window-options command.  All window options are documented with the
     set-window-option command.

     tmux also supports user options which are prefixed with a ‘@’.  User options may have any name, so long as they are prefixed with ‘@’, and be set to any
     string.  For example:

           $ tmux setw -q @foo "abc123"
           $ tmux showw -v @foo
           abc123

     Commands which set options are as follows:

     set-option [-aFgoqsuw] [-t target-session | target-window] option value
                   (alias: set)
             Set a window option with -w (equivalent to the set-window-option command), a server option with -s, otherwise a session option.  If -g is given, the
             global session or window option is set.  -F expands formats in the option value.  The -u flag unsets an option, so a session inherits the option from
             the global options (or with -g, restores a global option to the default).

             The -o flag prevents setting an option that is already set and the -q flag suppresses errors about unknown or ambiguous options.

             With -a, and if the option expects a string or a style, value is appended to the existing setting.  For example:

                   set -g status-left "foo"
                   set -ag status-left "bar"

             Will result in ‘foobar’.  And:

                   set -g status-style "bg=red"
                   set -ag status-style "fg=blue"

             Will result in a red background and blue foreground.  Without -a, the result would be the default background and a blue foreground.

             Available window options are listed under set-window-option.

             value depends on the option and may be a number, a string, or a flag (on, off, or omitted to toggle).

             Available server options are:

             buffer-limit number
                     Set the number of buffers; as new buffers are added to the top of the stack, old ones are removed from the bottom if necessary to maintain this
                     maximum length.

             command-alias[] name=value
                     This is an array of custom aliases for commands.  If an unknown command matches name, it is replaced with value.  For example, after:

                           set -s command-alias[100] zoom='resize-pane -Z'

                     Using:

                           zoom -t:.1

                     Is equivalent to:

                           resize-pane -Z -t:.1

                     Note that aliases are expanded when a command is parsed rather than when it is executed, so binding an alias with bind-key will bind the
                     expanded form.

             default-terminal terminal
                     Set the default terminal for new windows created in this session - the default value of the TERM environment variable.  For tmux to work cor‐
                     rectly, this must be set to ‘screen’, ‘tmux’ or a derivative of them.

             escape-time time
                     Set the time in milliseconds for which tmux waits after an escape is input to determine if it is part of a function or meta key sequences.  The
                     default is 500 milliseconds.

             exit-unattached [on | off]
                     If enabled, the server will exit when there are no attached clients.

             focus-events [on | off]
                     When enabled, focus events are requested from the terminal if supported and passed through to applications running in tmux.  Attached clients
                     should be detached and attached again after changing this option.

             history-file path
                     If not empty, a file to which tmux will write command prompt history on exit and load it from on start.

             message-limit number
                     Set the number of error or information messages to save in the message log for each client.  The default is 100.

             set-clipboard [on | external | off]
                     Attempt to set the terminal clipboard content using the xterm(1) escape sequence, if there is an Ms entry in the terminfo(5) description (see
                     the TERMINFO EXTENSIONS section).

                     If set to on, tmux will both accept the escape sequence to create a buffer and attempt to set the terminal clipboard.  If set to external, tmux
                     will attempt to set the terminal clipboard but ignore attempts by applications to set tmux buffers.  If off, tmux will neither accept the clip‐
                     board escape sequence nor attempt to set the clipboard.

                     Note that this feature needs to be enabled in xterm(1) by setting the resource:

                           disallowedWindowOps: 20,21,SetXprop

                     Or changing this property from the xterm(1) interactive menu when required.

             terminal-overrides[] string
                     Allow terminal descriptions read using terminfo(5) to be overridden.  Each entry is a colon-separated string made up of a terminal type pattern
                     (matched using fnmatch(3)) and a set of name=value entries.

                     For example, to set the ‘clear’ terminfo(5) entry to ‘\e[H\e[2J’ for all terminal types matching ‘rxvt*’:

                           rxvt*:clear=\e[H\e[2J

                     The terminal entry value is passed through strunvis(3) before interpretation.

             Available session options are:

             activity-action [any | none | current | other]
                     Set action on window activity when monitor-activity is on.  any means activity in any window linked to a session causes a bell or message
                     (depending on visual-activity) in the current window of that session, none means all activity is ignored (equivalent to monitor-activity being
                     off), current means only activity in windows other than the current window are ignored and other means activity in the current window is
                     ignored but not those in other windows.

             assume-paste-time milliseconds
                     If keys are entered faster than one in milliseconds, they are assumed to have been pasted rather than typed and tmux key bindings are not pro‐
                     cessed.  The default is one millisecond and zero disables.

             base-index index
                     Set the base index from which an unused index should be searched when a new window is created.  The default is zero.

             bell-action [any | none | current | other]
                     Set action on a bell in a window when monitor-bell is on.  The values are the same as those for activity-action.

             default-command shell-command
                     Set the command used for new windows (if not specified when the window is created) to shell-command, which may be any sh(1) command.  The
                     default is an empty string, which instructs tmux to create a login shell using the value of the default-shell option.

             default-shell path
                     Specify the default shell.  This is used as the login shell for new windows when the default-command option is set to empty, and must be the
                     full path of the executable.  When started tmux tries to set a default value from the first suitable of the SHELL environment variable, the
                     shell returned by getpwuid(3), or /bin/sh.  This option should be configured when tmux is used as a login shell.

             destroy-unattached [on | off]
                     If enabled and the session is no longer attached to any clients, it is destroyed.

             detach-on-destroy [on | off]
                     If on (the default), the client is detached when the session it is attached to is destroyed.  If off, the client is switched to the most
                     recently active of the remaining sessions.

             display-panes-active-colour colour
                     Set the colour used by the display-panes command to show the indicator for the active pane.

             display-panes-colour colour
                     Set the colour used by the display-panes command to show the indicators for inactive panes.

             display-panes-time time
                     Set the time in milliseconds for which the indicators shown by the display-panes command appear.

             display-time time
                     Set the amount of time for which status line messages and other on-screen indicators are displayed.  If set to 0, messages and indicators are
                     displayed until a key is pressed.  time is in milliseconds.

             history-limit lines
                     Set the maximum number of lines held in window history.  This setting applies only to new windows - existing window histories are not resized
                     and retain the limit at the point they were created.

             key-table key-table
                     Set the default key table to key-table instead of root.

             lock-after-time number
                     Lock the session (like the lock-session command) after number seconds of inactivity.  The default is not to lock (set to 0).

             lock-command shell-command
                     Command to run when locking each client.  The default is to run lock(1) with -np.

             message-command-style style
                     Set status line message command style, where style is a comma-separated list of characteristics to be specified.

                     These may be ‘bg=colour’ to set the background colour, ‘fg=colour’ to set the foreground colour, and a list of attributes as specified below.

                     The colour is one of: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white, aixterm bright variants (if supported: brightred, brightgreen, and
                     so on), colour0 to colour255 from the 256-colour set, default, or a hexadecimal RGB string such as ‘#ffffff’, which chooses the closest match
                     from the default 256-colour set.

                     The attributes is either none or a comma-delimited list of one or more of: bright (or bold), dim, underscore, blink, reverse, hidden, italics,
                     or strikethrough to turn an attribute on, or an attribute prefixed with ‘no’ to turn one off.

                     Examples are:

                           fg=yellow,bold,underscore,blink
                           bg=black,fg=default,noreverse

                     With the -a flag to the set-option command the new style is added otherwise the existing style is replaced.

             message-style style
                     Set status line message style.  For how to specify style, see the message-command-style option.

             mouse [on | off]
                     If on, tmux captures the mouse and allows mouse events to be bound as key bindings.  See the MOUSE SUPPORT section for details.

             prefix key
                     Set the key accepted as a prefix key.  In addition to the standard keys described under KEY BINDINGS, prefix can be set to the special key
                     ‘None’ to set no prefix.

             prefix2 key
                     Set a secondary key accepted as a prefix key.  Like prefix, prefix2 can be set to ‘None’.

             renumber-windows [on | off]
                     If on, when a window is closed in a session, automatically renumber the other windows in numerical order.  This respects the base-index option
                     if it has been set.  If off, do not renumber the windows.

             repeat-time time
                     Allow multiple commands to be entered without pressing the prefix-key again in the specified time milliseconds (the default is 500).  Whether a
                     key repeats may be set when it is bound using the -r flag to bind-key.  Repeat is enabled for the default keys bound to the resize-pane com‐
                     mand.

             set-titles [on | off]
                     Attempt to set the client terminal title using the tsl and fsl terminfo(5) entries if they exist.  tmux automatically sets these to the
                     \e]0;...\007 sequence if the terminal appears to be xterm(1).  This option is off by default.

             set-titles-string string
                     String used to set the window title if set-titles is on.  Formats are expanded, see the FORMATS section.

             silence-action [any | none | current | other]
                     Set action on window silence when monitor-silence is on.  The values are the same as those for activity-action.

             status [on | off]
                     Show or hide the status line.

             status-interval interval
                     Update the status line every interval seconds.  By default, updates will occur every 15 seconds.  A setting of zero disables redrawing at
                     interval.

             status-justify [left | centre | right]
                     Set the position of the window list component of the status line: left, centre or right justified.

             status-keys [vi | emacs]
                     Use vi or emacs-style key bindings in the status line, for example at the command prompt.  The default is emacs, unless the VISUAL or EDITOR
                     environment variables are set and contain the string ‘vi’.

             status-left string
                     Display string (by default the session name) to the left of the status line.  string will be passed through strftime(3) and formats (see
                     FORMATS) will be expanded.  It may also contain the special character sequence #[] to change the colour or attributes, for example
                     ‘#[fg=red,bright]’ to set a bright red foreground.  See the message-command-style option for a description of colours and attributes.

                     For details on how the names and titles can be set see the NAMES AND TITLES section.

                     Examples are:

                           #(sysctl vm.loadavg)
                           #[fg=yellow,bold]#(apm -l)%%#[default] [#S]

                     The default is ‘[#S] ’.

             status-left-length length
                     Set the maximum length of the left component of the status line.  The default is 10.

             status-left-style style
                     Set the style of the left part of the status line.  For how to specify style, see the message-command-style option.

             status-position [top | bottom]
                     Set the position of the status line.

             status-right string
                     Display string to the right of the status line.  By default, the current pane title in double quotes, the date and the time are shown.  As with
                     status-left, string will be passed to strftime(3) and character pairs are replaced.

             status-right-length length
                     Set the maximum length of the right component of the status line.  The default is 40.

             status-right-style style
                     Set the style of the right part of the status line.  For how to specify style, see the message-command-style option.

             status-style style
                     Set status line style.  For how to specify style, see the message-command-style option.

             update-environment[] variable
                     Set list of environment variables to be copied into the session environment when a new session is created or an existing session is attached.
                     Any variables that do not exist in the source environment are set to be removed from the session environment (as if -r was given to the
                     set-environment command).

             user-keys[] key
                     Set list of user-defined key escape sequences.  Each item is associated with a key named ‘User0’, ‘User1’, and so on.

                     For example:

                           set -s user-keys[0] "\e[5;30012~"
                           bind User0 resize-pane -L 3

             visual-activity [on | off | both]
                     If on, display a message instead of sending a bell when activity occurs in a window for which the monitor-activity window option is enabled.
                     If set to both, a bell and a message are produced.

             visual-bell [on | off | both]
                     If on, a message is shown on a bell in a window for which the monitor-bell window option is enabled instead of it being passed through to the
                     terminal (which normally makes a sound).  If set to both, a bell and a message are produced.  Also see the bell-action option.

             visual-silence [on | off | both]
                     If monitor-silence is enabled, prints a message after the interval has expired on a given window instead of sending a bell.  If set to both, a
                     bell and a message are produced.

             word-separators string
                     Sets the session's conception of what characters are considered word separators, for the purposes of the next and previous word commands in
                     copy mode.  The default is ‘ -_@’.

     set-window-option [-aFgoqu] [-t target-window] option value
                   (alias: setw)
             Set a window option.  The -a, -F, -g, -o, -q and -u flags work similarly to the set-option command.

             Supported window options are:

             aggressive-resize [on | off]
                     Aggressively resize the chosen window.  This means that tmux will resize the window to the size of the smallest session for which it is the
                     current window, rather than the smallest session to which it is attached.  The window may resize when the current window is changed on another
                     sessions; this option is good for full-screen programs which support SIGWINCH and poor for interactive programs such as shells.

             allow-rename [on | off]
                     Allow programs to change the window name using a terminal escape sequence (\ek...\e\\).  The default is on.

             alternate-screen [on | off]
                     This option configures whether programs running inside tmux may use the terminal alternate screen feature, which allows the smcup and rmcup
                     terminfo(5) capabilities.  The alternate screen feature preserves the contents of the window when an interactive application starts and
                     restores it on exit, so that any output visible before the application starts reappears unchanged after it exits.  The default is on.

             automatic-rename [on | off]
                     Control automatic window renaming.  When this setting is enabled, tmux will rename the window automatically using the format specified by
                     automatic-rename-format.  This flag is automatically disabled for an individual window when a name is specified at creation with new-window or
                     new-session, or later with rename-window, or with a terminal escape sequence.  It may be switched off globally with:

                           set-window-option -g automatic-rename off

             automatic-rename-format format
                     The format (see FORMATS) used when the automatic-rename option is enabled.

             clock-mode-colour colour
                     Set clock colour.

             clock-mode-style [12 | 24]
                     Set clock hour format.

             force-height height
             force-width width
                     Prevent tmux from resizing a window to greater than width or height.  A value of zero restores the default unlimited setting.

             main-pane-height height
             main-pane-width width
                     Set the width or height of the main (left or top) pane in the main-horizontal or main-vertical layouts.

             mode-keys [vi | emacs]
                     Use vi or emacs-style key bindings in copy mode.  The default is emacs, unless VISUAL or EDITOR contains ‘vi’.

             mode-style style
                     Set window modes style.  For how to specify style, see the message-command-style option.

             monitor-activity [on | off]
                     Monitor for activity in the window.  Windows with activity are highlighted in the status line.

             monitor-bell [on | off]
                     Monitor for a bell in the window.  Windows with a bell are highlighted in the status line.

             monitor-silence [interval]
                     Monitor for silence (no activity) in the window within interval seconds.  Windows that have been silent for the interval are highlighted in the
                     status line.  An interval of zero disables the monitoring.

             other-pane-height height
                     Set the height of the other panes (not the main pane) in the main-horizontal layout.  If this option is set to 0 (the default), it will have no
                     effect.  If both the main-pane-height and other-pane-height options are set, the main pane will grow taller to make the other panes the speci‐
                     fied height, but will never shrink to do so.

             other-pane-width width
                     Like other-pane-height, but set the width of other panes in the main-vertical layout.

             pane-active-border-style style
                     Set the pane border style for the currently active pane.  For how to specify style, see the message-command-style option.  Attributes are
                     ignored.

             pane-base-index index
                     Like base-index, but set the starting index for pane numbers.

             pane-border-format format
                     Set the text shown in pane border status lines.

             pane-border-status [off | top | bottom]
                     Turn pane border status lines off or set their position.

             pane-border-style style
                     Set the pane border style for panes aside from the active pane.  For how to specify style, see the message-command-style option.  Attributes
                     are ignored.

             remain-on-exit [on | off]
                     A window with this flag set is not destroyed when the program running in it exits.  The window may be reactivated with the respawn-window com‐
                     mand.

             synchronize-panes [on | off]
                     Duplicate input to any pane to all other panes in the same window (only for panes that are not in any special mode).

             window-active-style style
                     Set the style for the window's active pane.  For how to specify style, see the message-command-style option.

             window-status-activity-style style
                     Set status line style for windows with an activity alert.  For how to specify style, see the message-command-style option.

             window-status-bell-style style
                     Set status line style for windows with a bell alert.  For how to specify style, see the message-command-style option.

             window-status-current-format string
                     Like window-status-format, but is the format used when the window is the current window.

             window-status-current-style style
                     Set status line style for the currently active window.  For how to specify style, see the message-command-style option.

             window-status-format string
                     Set the format in which the window is displayed in the status line window list.  See the status-left option for details of special character
                     sequences available.  The default is ‘#I:#W#F’.

             window-status-last-style style
                     Set status line style for the last active window.  For how to specify style, see the message-command-style option.

             window-status-separator string
                     Sets the separator drawn between windows in the status line.  The default is a single space character.

             window-status-style style
                     Set status line style for a single window.  For how to specify style, see the message-command-style option.

             window-style style
                     Set the default window style.  For how to specify style, see the message-command-style option.

             wrap-search [on | off]
                     If this option is set, searches will wrap around the end of the pane contents.  The default is on.

             xterm-keys [on | off]
                     If this option is set, tmux will generate xterm(1) -style function key sequences; these have a number included to indicate modifiers such as
                     Shift, Alt or Ctrl.

     show-options [-gqsvw] [-t target-session | target-window] [option]
                   (alias: show)
             Show the window options (or a single window option if given) with -w (equivalent to show-window-options), the server options with -s, otherwise the
             session options for target session.  Global session or window options are listed if -g is used.  -v shows only the option value, not the name.  If -q
             is set, no error will be returned if option is unset.

     show-window-options [-gv] [-t target-window] [option]
                   (alias: showw)
             List the window options or a single option for target-window, or the global window options if -g is used.  -v shows only the option value, not the
             name.

HOOKS
     tmux allows commands to run on various triggers, called hooks.  Most tmux commands have an after hook and there are a number of hooks not associated with com‐
     mands.

     A command's after hook is run after it completes, except when the command is run as part of a hook itself.  They are named with an ‘after-’ prefix.  For exam‐
     ple, the following command adds a hook to select the even-vertical layout after every split-window:

           set-hook after-split-window "selectl even-vertical"

     In addition, the following hooks are available:

     alert-activity          Run when a window has activity.  See monitor-activity.

     alert-bell              Run when a window has received a bell.  See monitor-bell.

     alert-silence           Run when a window has been silent.  See monitor-silence.

     client-attached         Run when a client is attached.

     client-detached         Run when a client is detached

     client-resized          Run when a client is resized.

     client-session-changed  Run when a client's attached session is changed.

     pane-died               Run when the program running in a pane exits, but remain-on-exit is on so the pane has not closed.

     pane-exited             Run when the program running in a pane exits.

     pane-set-clipboard      Run when the terminal clipboard is set using the xterm(1) escape sequence.

     session-created         Run when a new session created.

     session-closed          Run when a session closed.

     session-renamed         Run when a session is renamed.

     window-linked           Run when a window is linked into a session.

     window-renamed          Run when a window is renamed.

     window-unlinked         Run when a window is unlinked from a session.

     Hooks are managed with these commands:

     set-hook [-gu] [-t target-session] hook-name command
             Sets (or with -u unsets) hook hook-name to command.  If -g is given, hook-name is added to the global list of hooks, otherwise it is added to the ses‐
             sion hooks (for target-session with -t).  Like options, session hooks inherit from the global ones.

     show-hooks [-g] [-t target-session]
             Shows the global list of hooks with -g, otherwise the session hooks.

MOUSE SUPPORT
     If the mouse option is on (the default is off), tmux allows mouse events to be bound as keys.  The name of each key is made up of a mouse event (such as
     ‘MouseUp1’) and a location suffix (one of ‘Pane’ for the contents of a pane, ‘Border’ for a pane border or ‘Status’ for the status line).  The following mouse
     events are available:

           WheelUp       WheelDown
           MouseDown1    MouseUp1      MouseDrag1   MouseDragEnd1
           MouseDown2    MouseUp2      MouseDrag2   MouseDragEnd2
           MouseDown3    MouseUp3      MouseDrag3   MouseDragEnd3
           DoubleClick1  DoubleClick2  DoubleClick3 WheelUp
           TripleClick1  TripleClick2  TripleClick3 WheelDown

     Each should be suffixed with a location, for example ‘MouseDown1Status’.

     The special token ‘{mouse}’ or ‘=’ may be used as target-window or target-pane in commands bound to mouse key bindings.  It resolves to the window or pane over
     which the mouse event took place (for example, the window in the status line over which button 1 was released for a ‘MouseUp1Status’ binding, or the pane over
     which the wheel was scrolled for a ‘WheelDownPane’ binding).

     The send-keys -M flag may be used to forward a mouse event to a pane.

     The default key bindings allow the mouse to be used to select and resize panes, to copy text and to change window using the status line.  These take effect if
     the mouse option is turned on.

FORMATS
     Certain commands accept the -F flag with a format argument.  This is a string which controls the output format of the command.  Replacement variables are
     enclosed in ‘#{’ and ‘}’, for example ‘#{session_name}’.  The possible variables are listed in the table below, or the name of a tmux option may be used for an
     option's value.  Some variables have a shorter alias such as ‘#S’, and ‘##’ is replaced by a single ‘#’.

     Conditionals are available by prefixing with ‘?’ and separating two alternatives with a comma; if the specified variable exists and is not zero, the first
     alternative is chosen, otherwise the second is used.  For example ‘#{?session_attached,attached,not attached}’ will include the string ‘attached’ if the ses‐
     sion is attached and the string ‘not attached’ if it is unattached, or ‘#{?automatic-rename,yes,no}’ will include ‘yes’ if automatic-rename is enabled, or ‘no’
     if not.

     Comparisons may be expressed by prefixing two comma-separated alternatives by ‘==’ or ‘!=’ and a colon.  For example ‘#{==:#{host},myhost}’ will be replaced by
     ‘1’ if running on ‘myhost’, otherwise by ‘0’.  An ‘m’ specifies an fnmatch(3) comparison where the first argument is the pattern and the second the string to
     compare, for example ‘#{m:*foo*,#{host}}’.  ‘||’ and ‘&&’ evaluate to true if either or both of two comma-separated alternatives are true, for example
     ‘#{||,#{pane_in_mode},#{alternate_on}}’.  A ‘C’ performs a search for an fnmatch(3) pattern in the pane content and evaluates to zero if not found, or a line
     number if found.

     A limit may be placed on the length of the resultant string by prefixing it by an ‘=’, a number and a colon.  Positive numbers count from the start of the
     string and negative from the end, so ‘#{=5:pane_title}’ will include at most the first 5 characters of the pane title, or ‘#{=-5:pane_title}’ the last 5 char‐
     acters.  Prefixing a time variable with ‘t:’ will convert it to a string, so if ‘#{window_activity}’ gives ‘1445765102’, ‘#{t:window_activity}’ gives ‘Sun Oct
     25 09:25:02 2015’.  The ‘b:’ and ‘d:’ prefixes are basename(3) and dirname(3) of the variable respectively.  A prefix of the form ‘s/foo/bar/:’ will substitute
     ‘foo’ with ‘bar’ throughout.

     In addition, the first line of a shell command's output may be inserted using ‘#()’.  For example, ‘#(uptime)’ will insert the system's uptime.  When con‐
     structing formats, tmux does not wait for ‘#()’ commands to finish; instead, the previous result from running the same command is used, or a placeholder if the
     command has not been run before.  If the command hasn't exited, the most recent line of output will be used, but the status line will not be updated more than
     once a second.  Commands are executed with the tmux global environment set (see the ENVIRONMENT section).

     The following variables are available, where appropriate:

     Variable name          Alias    Replaced with
     alternate_on                    If pane is in alternate screen
     alternate_saved_x               Saved cursor X in alternate screen

NAMES AND TITLES
     tmux distinguishes between names and titles.  Windows and sessions have names, which may be used to specify them in targets and are displayed in the status
     line and various lists: the name is the tmux identifier for a window or session.  Only panes have titles.  A pane's title is typically set by the program run‐
     ning inside the pane using an escape sequence (like it would set the xterm(1) window title in X(7)).  Windows themselves do not have titles - a window's title
     is the title of its active pane.  tmux itself may set the title of the terminal in which the client is running, see the set-titles option.

     A session's name is set with the new-session and rename-session commands.  A window's name is set with one of:

     1.      A command argument (such as -n for new-window or new-session).

     2.      An escape sequence:

                   $ printf '\033kWINDOW_NAME\033\\'

     3.      Automatic renaming, which sets the name to the active command in the window's active pane.  See the automatic-rename option.

     When a pane is first created, its title is the hostname.  A pane's title can be set via the OSC title setting sequence, for example:

           $ printf '\033]2;My Title\033\\'

     It can also be modified with the select-pane -T command.

ENVIRONMENT
     When the server is started, tmux copies the environment into the global environment; in addition, each session has a session environment.  When a window is
     created, the session and global environments are merged.  If a variable exists in both, the value from the session environment is used.  The result is the ini‐
     tial environment passed to the new process.

     The update-environment session option may be used to update the session environment from the client when a new session is created or an old reattached.  tmux
     also initialises the TMUX variable with some internal information to allow commands to be executed from inside, and the TERM variable with the correct terminal
     setting of ‘screen’.

     Commands to alter and view the environment are:

     set-environment [-gru] [-t target-session] name [value]
                   (alias: setenv)
             Set or unset an environment variable.  If -g is used, the change is made in the global environment; otherwise, it is applied to the session environment
             for target-session.  The -u flag unsets a variable.  -r indicates the variable is to be removed from the environment before starting a new process.

     show-environment [-gs] [-t target-session] [variable]
                   (alias: showenv)
             Display the environment for target-session or the global environment with -g.  If variable is omitted, all variables are shown.  Variables removed from
             the environment are prefixed with ‘-’.  If -s is used, the output is formatted as a set of Bourne shell commands.

STATUS LINE
     tmux includes an optional status line which is displayed in the bottom line of each terminal.  By default, the status line is enabled (it may be disabled with
     the status session option) and contains, from left-to-right: the name of the current session in square brackets; the window list; the title of the active pane
     in double quotes; and the time and date.

     The status line is made of three parts: configurable left and right sections (which may contain dynamic content such as the time or output from a shell com‐
     mand, see the status-left, status-left-length, status-right, and status-right-length options below), and a central window list.  By default, the window list
     shows the index, name and (if any) flag of the windows present in the current session in ascending numerical order.  It may be customised with the
     window-status-format and window-status-current-format options.  The flag is one of the following symbols appended to the window name:

           Symbol    Meaning
           *         Denotes the current window.
           -         Marks the last window (previously selected).
           #         Window activity is monitored and activity has been detected.
           !         Window bells are monitored and a bell has occurred in the window.
           ~         The window has been silent for the monitor-silence interval.
           M         The window contains the marked pane.
           Z         The window's active pane is zoomed.

     The # symbol relates to the monitor-activity window option.  The window name is printed in inverted colours if an alert (bell, activity or silence) is present.

     The colour and attributes of the status line may be configured, the entire status line using the status-style session option and individual windows using the
     window-status-style window option.

     The status line is automatically refreshed at interval if it has changed, the interval may be controlled with the status-interval session option.

     Commands related to the status line are as follows:

     command-prompt [-1i] [-I inputs] [-p prompts] [-t target-client] [template]
             Open the command prompt in a client.  This may be used from inside tmux to execute commands interactively.

             If template is specified, it is used as the command.  If present, -I is a comma-separated list of the initial text for each prompt.  If -p is given,
             prompts is a comma-separated list of prompts which are displayed in order; otherwise a single prompt is displayed, constructed from template if it is
             present, or ‘:’ if not.

             Before the command is executed, the first occurrence of the string ‘%%’ and all occurrences of ‘%1’ are replaced by the response to the first prompt,
             all ‘%2’ are replaced with the response to the second prompt, and so on for further prompts.  Up to nine prompt responses may be replaced (‘%1’ to
             ‘%9’).  ‘%%%’ is like ‘%%’ but any quotation marks are escaped.

             -1 makes the prompt only accept one key press, in this case the resulting input is a single character.  -i executes the command every time the prompt
             input changes instead of when the user exits the command prompt.

             The following keys have a special meaning in the command prompt, depending on the value of the status-keys option:

                   Function                             vi        emacs
                   Cancel command prompt                Escape    Escape

     confirm-before [-p prompt] [-t target-client] command
                   (alias: confirm)
             Ask for confirmation before executing command.  If -p is given, prompt is the prompt to display; otherwise a prompt is constructed from command.  It
             may contain the special character sequences supported by the status-left option.

             This command works only from inside tmux.

     display-message [-p] [-c target-client] [-t target-pane] [message]
                   (alias: display)
             Display a message.  If -p is given, the output is printed to stdout, otherwise it is displayed in the target-client status line.  The format of message
             is described in the FORMATS section; information is taken from target-pane if -t is given, otherwise the active pane for the session attached to
             target-client.

BUFFERS
     tmux maintains a set of named paste buffers.  Each buffer may be either explicitly or automatically named.  Explicitly named buffers are named when created
     with the set-buffer or load-buffer commands, or by renaming an automatically named buffer with set-buffer -n.  Automatically named buffers are given a name
     such as ‘buffer0001’, ‘buffer0002’ and so on.  When the buffer-limit option is reached, the oldest automatically named buffer is deleted.  Explicitly named
     buffers are not subject to buffer-limit and may be deleted with delete-buffer command.

     Buffers may be added using copy-mode or the set-buffer and load-buffer commands, and pasted into a window using the paste-buffer command.  If a buffer command
     is used and no buffer is specified, the most recently added automatically named buffer is assumed.

     A configurable history buffer is also maintained for each window.  By default, up to 2000 lines are kept; this can be altered with the history-limit option
     (see the set-option command above).

     The buffer commands are as follows:

     choose-buffer [-N] [-F format] [-f filter] [-O sort-order] [-t target-pane] [template]
             Put a pane into buffer mode, where a buffer may be chosen interactively from a list.  The following keys may be used in buffer mode:

                   Key    Function
                   Enter  Choose selected buffer
                   Up     Select previous buffer
                   Down   Select next buffer
                   C-s    Search by name or content
                   n      Repeat last search
                   t      Toggle if buffer is tagged
                   T      Tag no buffers
                   C-t    Tag all buffers
                   d      Delete selected buffer
                   D      Delete tagged buffers
                   f      Enter a format to filter items
                   O      Change sort order
                   v      Toggle preview
                   q      Exit mode

             After a buffer is chosen, ‘%%’ is replaced by the buffer name in template and the result executed as a command.  If template is not given, "paste-buf‐
             fer -b '%%'" is used.

             -O specifies the initial sort order: one of ‘time’, ‘name’ or ‘size’.  -f specifies an initial filter: the filter is a format - if it evaluates to
             zero, the item in the list is not shown, otherwise it is shown.  If a filter would lead to an empty list, it is ignored.  -F specifies the format for
             each item in the list.  -N starts without the preview.  This command works only if at least one client is attached.

     clear-history [-t target-pane]
                   (alias: clearhist)
             Remove and free the history for the specified pane.

     delete-buffer [-b buffer-name]
                   (alias: deleteb)
             Delete the buffer named buffer-name, or the most recently added automatically named buffer if not specified.

     list-buffers [-F format]
                   (alias: lsb)
             List the global buffers.  For the meaning of the -F flag, see the FORMATS section.

     load-buffer [-b buffer-name] path
                   (alias: loadb)
             Load the contents of the specified paste buffer from path.

     paste-buffer [-dpr] [-b buffer-name] [-s separator] [-t target-pane]
                   (alias: pasteb)
             Insert the contents of a paste buffer into the specified pane.  If not specified, paste into the current one.  With -d, also delete the paste buffer.
             When output, any linefeed (LF) characters in the paste buffer are replaced with a separator, by default carriage return (CR).  A custom separator may
             be specified using the -s flag.  The -r flag means to do no replacement (equivalent to a separator of LF).  If -p is specified, paste bracket control
             codes are inserted around the buffer if the application has requested bracketed paste mode.

     save-buffer [-a] [-b buffer-name] path
                   (alias: saveb)
             Save the contents of the specified paste buffer to path.  The -a option appends to rather than overwriting the file.

     set-buffer [-a] [-b buffer-name] [-n new-buffer-name] data
                   (alias: setb)
             Set the contents of the specified buffer to data.  The -a option appends to rather than overwriting the buffer.  The -n option renames the buffer to
             new-buffer-name.

     show-buffer [-b buffer-name]
                   (alias: showb)
             Display the contents of the specified buffer.

MISCELLANEOUS
     Miscellaneous commands are as follows:

     clock-mode [-t target-pane]
             Display a large clock.

     if-shell [-bF] [-t target-pane] shell-command command [command]
                   (alias: if)
             Execute the first command if shell-command returns success or the second command otherwise.  Before being executed, shell-command is expanded using the
             rules specified in the FORMATS section, including those relevant to target-pane.  With -b, shell-command is run in the background.

             If -F is given, shell-command is not executed but considered success if neither empty nor zero (after formats are expanded).

     lock-server
                   (alias: lock)
             Lock each client individually by running the command specified by the lock-command option.

     run-shell [-b] [-t target-pane] shell-command
                   (alias: run)
             Execute shell-command in the background without creating a window.  Before being executed, shell-command is expanded using the rules specified in the
             FORMATS section.  With -b, the command is run in the background.  After it finishes, any output to stdout is displayed in copy mode (in the pane speci‐
             fied by -t or the current pane if omitted).  If the command doesn't return success, the exit status is also displayed.

     wait-for [-L | -S | -U] channel
                   (alias: wait)
             When used without options, prevents the client from exiting until woken using wait-for -S with the same channel.  When -L is used, the channel is
             locked and any clients that try to lock the same channel are made to wait until the channel is unlocked with wait-for -U.  This command only works from
             outside tmux.

TERMINFO EXTENSIONS
     tmux understands some unofficial extensions to terminfo(5):

     Cs, Cr  Set the cursor colour.  The first takes a single string argument and is used to set the colour; the second takes no arguments and restores the default
             cursor colour.  If set, a sequence such as this may be used to change the cursor colour from inside tmux:

                   $ printf '\033]12;red\033\\'

     Ss, Se  Set or reset the cursor style.  If set, a sequence such as this may be used to change the cursor to an underline:

                   $ printf '\033[4 q'

             If Se is not set, Ss with argument 0 will be used to reset the cursor style instead.

     Tc      Indicate that the terminal supports the ‘direct colour’ RGB escape sequence (for example, \e[38;2;255;255;255m).

             If supported, this is used for the OSC initialize colour escape sequence (which may be enabled by adding the ‘initc’ and ‘ccc’ capabilities to the tmux
             terminfo(5) entry).

     Ms      Store the current buffer in the host terminal's selection (clipboard).  See the set-clipboard option above and the xterm(1) man page.

CONTROL MODE
     tmux offers a textual interface called control mode.  This allows applications to communicate with tmux using a simple text-only protocol.

     In control mode, a client sends tmux commands or command sequences terminated by newlines on standard input.  Each command will produce one block of output on
     standard output.  An output block consists of a %begin line followed by the output (which may be empty).  The output block ends with a %end or %error.  %begin
     and matching %end or %error have two arguments: an integer time (as seconds from epoch) and command number.  For example:

           %begin 1363006971 2
           0: ksh* (1 panes) [80x24] [layout b25f,80x24,0,0,2] @2 (active)
           %end 1363006971 2

     The refresh-client -C command may be used to set the size of a client in control mode.

     In control mode, tmux outputs notifications.  A notification will never occur inside an output block.

     The following notifications are defined:

     %client-session-changed client session-id name
             The client is now attached to the session with ID session-id, which is named name.

     %exit [reason]
             The tmux client is exiting immediately, either because it is not attached to any session or an error occurred.  If present, reason describes why the
             client exited.

     %layout-change window-id window-layout window-visible-layout window-flags
             The layout of a window with ID window-id changed.  The new layout is window-layout.  The window's visible layout is window-visible-layout and the win‐
             dow flags are window-flags.

     %output pane-id value
             A window pane produced output.  value escapes non-printable characters and backslash as octal \xxx.

     %pane-mode-changed pane-id
             The pane with ID pane-id has changed mode.

     %session-changed session-id name
             The client is now attached to the session with ID session-id, which is named name.

     %session-renamed name
             The current session was renamed to name.

     %session-window-changed session-id window-id
             The session with ID session-id changed its active window to the window with ID window-id.

     %sessions-changed
             A session was created or destroyed.

     %unlinked-window-add window-id
             The window with ID window-id was created but is not linked to the current session.

     %window-add window-id
             The window with ID window-id was linked to the current session.

     %window-close window-id
             The window with ID window-id closed.

     %window-pane-changed window-id pane-id
             The active pane in the window with ID window-id changed to the pane with ID pane-id.

     %window-renamed window-id name
             The window with ID window-id was renamed to name.

FILES
     ~/.tmux.conf       Default tmux configuration file.
     /etc/tmux.conf     System-wide configuration file.

EXAMPLES
     To create a new tmux session running vi(1):

           $ tmux new-session vi

     Most commands have a shorter form, known as an alias.  For new-session, this is new:

           $ tmux new vi

     Alternatively, the shortest unambiguous form of a command is accepted.  If there are several options, they are listed:

           $ tmux n
           ambiguous command: n, could be: new-session, new-window, next-window

     Within an active session, a new window may be created by typing ‘C-b c’ (Ctrl followed by the ‘b’ key followed by the ‘c’ key).

     Windows may be navigated with: ‘C-b 0’ (to select window 0), ‘C-b 1’ (to select window 1), and so on; ‘C-b n’ to select the next window; and ‘C-b p’ to select
     the previous window.

     A session may be detached using ‘C-b d’ (or by an external event such as ssh(1) disconnection) and reattached with:

           $ tmux attach-session

     Typing ‘C-b ?’ lists the current key bindings in the current window; up and down may be used to navigate the list or ‘q’ to exit from it.

     Commands to be run when the tmux server is started may be placed in the ~/.tmux.conf configuration file.  Common examples include:

     Changing the default prefix key:

           set-option -g prefix C-a
           unbind-key C-b
           bind-key C-a send-prefix

     Turning the status line off, or changing its colour:

           set-option -g status off
           set-option -g status-style bg=blue

     Setting other options, such as the default command, or locking after 30 minutes of inactivity:

           set-option -g default-command "exec /bin/ksh"
           set-option -g lock-after-time 1800

     Creating new key bindings:

           bind-key b set-option status
           bind-key / command-prompt "split-window 'exec man %%'"
           bind-key S command-prompt "new-window -n %1 'ssh %1'"
