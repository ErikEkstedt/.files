# Tmux Initializers

* A tmux server is created (does nothing if one already exists).
* A tmux session name is specified.
* The bash script checks if that session already exists and if its attached.
** If it is attached it prompts a message notification that states this fact.
** If it is not attached 

## base

The scripts heck if a specific tmux session is running
    
TODO: If the session is already attached then i3 should focus on that container.
