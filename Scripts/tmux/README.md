# Tmux Initializers

* Default tmux sessions are defined and run from a bash script. 
* The bash script checks if a session already exists and if its attached. If it's not attached it gets attached, if it's already attached nothing happens.
    
TODO: If the session is already attached then i3 should focus on that container.
